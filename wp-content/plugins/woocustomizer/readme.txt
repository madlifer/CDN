> [User 5 Star Rating:](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/only-5-stars-2/) This is by far in the top 3 of WP plugins, from all points of view: functionality, GUI, reliability, options… you name it. The only reason I don’t put it on the 1st place is because I just don’t know what other great plugins are out there but, on my personal book, this is definetely number one. For sure it’s worth every penny.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WooCustomizer work with my theme?
It should ! But as themes can add their own CSS or templates which might affect WooCustomizer from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://woocustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://woocustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

= Something doesn't look right or is slightly out in the design?
This could be from the theme you're using. Again, please [contact us](https://woocustomizer.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix or give you the CSS to fix it.

= Why the name change?
We've found out we're not really allowed to use the "Woo" prefix, so we're changing it to "StoreCustomizer"... and that still describes what the plugin does!
